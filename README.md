This section of the report delves into the data analysis and interpretation of a dataset of planes 
detailing planes’ flights across various locations over time. It focusses on Departure delays from 
the origin and Arrival delays at the destination airports within the United States of America 
(USA). 
The year ‘2006’ and ‘2007’ were selected for the analysis due to their substantial volume of 
data. Additionally, supplementary files containing airplane data were also utilized in the analysis 
process. 
This segment of the report encompasses several key areas: 
1. Data Cleaning Process: Detailing the steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for 
analysis. 
2. Optimal Time and Day for Minimizing Delays: Investigating the best times of day and 
days of the week to fly in order to reduce delays. 
3. Impact of Aircraft Age on Delays: Exploring whether older planes experience more 
delays. 
4. Model Development for Divert Predictions: Constructing a predictive model to anticipate 
flight diversions.
